# Neuro2022-EXC

Basic website made with Vanilla HTML and CSS. Small amount of Javascript for slideshow functionality.

Just an extra credit assignment for my Neuro-science class, not intended for real/commercial use.

Basic, one page website that will contain Homebar and sidebar with basic info. Main part of website will be a slideshow on 4 parts of the brain, with picture and then description underneath.

<h1>Basic Objectives:</h1>

Learn how to Implement a Slideshow with html/css/java/script including:

    Buttons to go to next/prev slide
    Basic styling with picture and then text/description
    Small animation on slide change (optional, may not have time)
    
All aspects of the website should be pretty scalable/Accessible.
