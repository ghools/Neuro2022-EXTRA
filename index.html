                        and hard to understand.
                        In the following slides you'll find some basic descriptions of the four(4) different main area's
                        of the cerebrum.</div>

                    <div class="text"> This is the frontal Lobe. As the name implies, it's right in the front of your
                        brain! The frontal lobe
                        is incredibly important, and does so many things! Some of the most important things it does is;
                        help control voluntary movement,
                        used heavily in expressive language, and maybe the most important things, executive functioning.
                        This is a pretty simplified view,
                        but the frontal lobe is incredibly important in controlling all kinds of functioning! This area
                        of the brain is also the last to fully develop.

                    <div class="text"> This is the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe is mainly used in processing sensory
                        information it recieves
                        from the outside world. Things like touch, taste, temperature, etc. are all connected to this
                        lobe, as well as lesser sensory
                        functioning like weight, shape, size, etc.

                    <div class="text"> This is the Occipital lobe. As you can see above, it's located directly in the
                        back of the brain.
                        The occipital lobe is mainly associated with vision. This could be visual perception, colors,
                        forms, shapes, and even tracking motion.

                        second largest lobe in the brain!
                        it's mainly responsible for auditory information, as well as very heavily involved in the
                        process of preserving both long term and current memories.</div>
